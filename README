FreeBSD Bugzilla Patch QA scripts (beta release).

This code allows downloading patches from one or more FreeBSD Bugzilla
PRs and applying them to a local repo.

This code relies on upstream code from the following git repository:

  https://github.com/conan-io/python-patch-ng/tree/master

which has an MIT license.  It is available in the FreeBSD ports tree
as devel/py-patch-ng.

Known problems as of 20250226:

 - PRs with multiple attachments only handle the first attachment.
   (There is missing iteration step.)
 - PRs with only obsolete patches are not handled gracefully.
 - Most patches in Base System/conf will not apply (they need a rewrite
   rules for e.g. "etc/"; cf. "make installworld" for why).
 - Certain src patches apply incorrectly.  This is due to bugs in the
   upstream code about fuzzing.

TODO items:

 - There is no cleaned up example script.
 - Needs parameterization of SKIP_IF_* rather than defines in the code.
 - The 'verbose' handling is all over the place; needs parameterization.
 - Base System PRs prepended with e.g. "/home/mylogin/src" are not
   handled properly (see note).
 - SKIP_IF is missing the "assigned to mailing list" case.
 - Missing all documentation.
 - Need an automated blocklist function vs. large queries (e.g. for bad
patches).

Note that a number of patches (especially against Base System) contain
bogus paths.  TBD: is it easier just to ask potential committers to edit
these patches themselves, rather than continue to tweak the code?  (e.g.
where is the point of diminishing returns?)

Results:

The results from the 20250218 run testing "all PRs since 2024-01-01 with
patches, except those marked In Progress" are below.  "got bug_id" is
output for each bug, and thus is the total count of examined PRs.

  grep "got bug_id:" *20250218 | wc -l
    766
  grep "already In Progress, skipping" *20250218 | wc -l
     91
  grep "patch applied" *20250218 | wc -l
    600
  grep "patch did not apply" *20250218 | wc -l
     48
  grep "no valid patches were found" *20250218* | wc -l
      8
  grep "unable to determine possible path to the patch, case 2" *20250218 | wc -l
      9
  grep "unable to reason about patches" *20250218 | wc -l
      7
  grep "there is no repository for Product 'Services'" *2025018 | wc -l
      1

leaving "2: other".

Analysis: 766/(600-91) implies 90.2% coverage.  However, this statistic
is known to decrease the older the PRs.  I have not yet quantified it.
